# MovieReccomendationSystem
## A quick overview of how it works:
[MovieRecs.py](MovieRecs.py) is the main file of this project: executing it is what creates the desired effect. All other files present were simply made to facilitate this file's creation and development.

The list of genres is housed directly within this file (since said list is small), while the list of keywords is housed in the [imdb-keywords.txt](imdb-keywords.txt) file. The three other Python files along with the other txt file were made to help procure, compile, and consolidate the long list of keywords into one place. This was done with both direct web-scraping along with the imdbpy library.
